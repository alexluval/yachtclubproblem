Applying the Declarative Approach to a Real-World Problem

The problem is to timetable a party at a yacht club. Certain boats are to be designated hosts, and the crews of the 
remaining boats in turn visit the host boats for several successive halfhour periods. 
The crew of a host boat remains on board to act as hosts while the crew of a guest boat together visits several hosts.
Every boat can only hold a limited number of people at a time (its capacity) and crew sizes are different.
The total number of people aboard a boat, including the host crew and guest crews, must not exceed the capacity. 
A guest boat cannot not revisit a host and guest crews cannot meet more than once.
The problem the rally organizer is facing is that of minimizing the number of host boats. 
Find the visit schedule and the host designations.
